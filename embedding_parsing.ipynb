      "1. Airline Name:El Al Israel Airlines; Overall_Rating:9; Review_Title:\"Service was excellent\"; Review Date:15th October 2018; Verified:True; Review: We just flew business, seats 2C&D on one of the new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and were extremely happy. Service was excellent. Lie flat seats excellent. VOD although not as good as Singapore Airlines nonetheless was very good. We've flown Singapore Airlines many times and El Al much to their credit has upped their game substantially and is on their way towards being a top 50 or even top 20 airlines! Food was delicious. El Al has ordered a total of 18 Dreamliners and as these become available the reviews will soar. The last time we flew on El Al was 10 years ago and at that time it was awful. Great to see it's turned it around big time! Boarding at JFK was unorganized and a joke. Boarding at Ben Gurion airport was smooth!; Aircraft:Boeing 787-9; Type Of Traveller:Couple Leisure; Seat Type:Business Class; Route:New York City to Tel Aviv ; Date Flown:October 2018; Seat Comfort:5.0; Cabin Staff Service:5.0; Food & Beverages:5.0; Ground Service:4.0; Inflight Entertainment:4.0; Wifi & Connectivity:3.0; Value For Money:5.0; Recommended:yes\n",
